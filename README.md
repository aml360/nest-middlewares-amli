# Nest Middlewares
Add the most common Express middlewares to your Nest app with one line.

## System Requirements
This packages requires the following:
- Node.JS 8.0.0 or later
- @nestjs/core and @nestjs/common 6.0.0 or later

## Adding Middlewares
Please do not open issues asking to support a middleware â€“ I've tried to make this project really easy to implement and extend. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how to create a new middleware, and I'll merge and release it if it meets the contributing guidelines. Thank you for your contribution.

## Usage
Take the name of your favorite Express middleware and prefix it with `@nest-middlewares/`.
```
$ npm install --save @nest-middlewares/helmet
```
In your module:
```ts
import { HelmetMiddleware } from '@nest-middlewares/helmet'; // (look around in the source code for the exact class name)

@Module(...)
export class MyModule {
    configure(consumer: MiddlewaresConsumer) {
        // IMPORTANT! Call Middleware.configure BEFORE using it for routes
        HelmetMiddleware.configure( /* options as per helmet docs */ )
        consumer.apply(HelmetMiddleware).forRoutes(
            /* your routes */
        );
    }
}
```
